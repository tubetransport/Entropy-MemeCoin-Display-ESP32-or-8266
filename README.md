# Entropy-MemeCoin-Display-ESP32-or-8266
This will fetch the $ENT price from a public API every 60secs and Display it on the SSD1306.

I created this fun little project while patiently waiting for my spot as a miner of $ENT, a hilarious memecoin. You can find the details at https://justentropy.lol
Since they use ESP32 Dev Boards for the "mining" I thought I would use the wait time to improve my coding skills on the ESP boards. I prevously wrote some code to display DOGE Coin price,I figiured it would be easy do do same for $ENT. Turns out I was wrong. After taking a few weeks to learn JSON, I was able to get it working. Remember I'm just an amature coder, dont hate my crap code! Sugestions welcome. 

To all you entropy "miners" in waiting: this is just a fun project to help you learn the in's and out's of programming the ESP32 you bought for mining. Enjoy!
Perhaps if the @entropy Devs like it, they will add to the "miner" code. Hope you all like the custom bmp!

For any serious miners: The skills I gained playing with these boards, and some good practice in the Linux world, led me to a much more difficult task, unbricking some KS0 Ultras. I'm happy to report the KS0's are working flawlessly. Maybe try my hand at overclocking them next???
